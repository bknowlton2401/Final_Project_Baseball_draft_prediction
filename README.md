# Final_Project_Baseball_draft_prediction
The purpose of this analysis is to see if there is a correlation between longevity and the draft round pick of a major league baseball player.

## Outline
### Playoff Appearances 2000-2015
- First I imported all MLB teams since the creation of Major League Baseball in 1871, through 2015.  Then I removed all teams previous to the year 2000. 
- Next I created a Histogram to show that from 2000-2015 to show the average season lengths was 162 games played by all teams.

- I created a histogram to show the number of times a team won the World Series between 2000-2015.

- I also created a dataframe to indicate if a team made it to the playoffs (includes a Division win, Wild Card entry, League win, and World Series win).

- From this dataframe I was able to create histogram to show how many times a team made the playoffs from 2000-2015.
